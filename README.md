# Live Project

## Introduction
Once finished with the individual courses at The Tech Academy, I interned with ProsperIT Consulting working on an ASP.NET MVC application.  This website utilized the Entity Framework to create an SQL database with the code-first approach.  The team operated using the AGILE methodology and we kept in touch through daily discussions, using Azure and Visual Studio to manage our progress.  It was a great experience to work with others, see how other developers were attacking problems, and how I could incorporate some of these strategies into my own thought process.  During the two-week sprint I worked on various front and back-end stories, usually adding features or capabilities to the website or helping to improve the UX experience, while gaining valuable project management and team programming skills.
